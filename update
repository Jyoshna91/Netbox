update(self, data)
 |      Update an object with a dictionary.
 |
 |      Accepts a dict and uses it to update the record and call save().
 |      For nested and choice fields you'd pass an int the same as
 |      if you were modifying the attribute and calling save().
 |
 |      :arg dict data: Dictionary containing the k/v to update the
 |          record object with.
 |      :returns: True if PATCH request was successful.
 |      :example:
 |
 |      >>> x = nb.dcim.devices.get(1)
 |      >>> x.update({
 |      ...   "name": "test-switch2",
 |      ...   "serial": "ABC321",
 |      ... })
 |      True


=============================

 |  updates(self)
 |      Compiles changes for an existing object into a dict.
 |
 |      Takes a diff between the objects current state and its state at init
 |      and returns them as a dictionary, which will be empty if no changes.
 |
 |      :returns: dict.
 |      :example:
 |
 |      >>> x = nb.dcim.devices.get(name='test1-a3-tor1b')
 |      >>> x.serial
 |      ''
 |      >>> x.serial = '1234'
 |      >>> x.updates()
 |      {'serial': '1234'}
 |      >>>
